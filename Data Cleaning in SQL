-- DATA CLEANING

-- now when we are data cleaning we usually follow a few steps
-- 1. check for duplicates and remove any
-- 2. standardize data and fix errors
-- 3. Look at null values 
-- 4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary 

use layoffs;  
SELECT * FROM layoffs.layoffs;
ALTER TABLE layoffs RENAME TO World_layoffs;

/* Staging table is a kind of temporary table were we will hold our data temporarily 
   It sereves as an intermediary step in data transformation process 
   A staging table acts as a backup, allowing data transformation without affecting the original dataset.*/

# First let's check for duplicates

 industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`) AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging;


-- This identifies duplicates rows and assigns row numbers to each duplicate set.
-- Insted of writing a nested subquery I have used CTE in order to simplify complex queries

-- Standardizing Data ( It's a process of finding issues in the data and fixing it)

SELECT company,
trim(company)
from layoffs_staging2;

-- By default trim() function removes leadind and trailing spaces from a string
-- It will make text column more standardized
UPDATE layoffs_staging
set company = trim(company);

-- if we look at industry it looks like we have some null and empty rows, let's take a look at these
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY 1;

-- I also noticed the Crypto has multiple different variations. We need to standardize that - let's say all to Crypto 
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';

-- everything looks good except apparently we have some "United States" and some "United States." with a period at the end. Let's standardize this.
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY 1;

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE country LIKE 'United States%'
ORDER BY 1;

-- In SQL, TRAILING is a keyword used with the TRIM() function to remove specific characters from the end (right side) of a string.
SELECT DISTINCT country, trim(trailing '.' FROM country)
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY 1;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = trim(trailing '.' FROM country)
WHERE country LIKE 'United States%';

-- now if we run this again it is fixed
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

-- Let's also fix the date columns:
SELECT `date`
FROM layoffs_staging2;

SELECT `date`,
str_to_date(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y')
FROM layoffs_staging2;

-- we can use str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = str_to_date(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- now we can convert the data type properly
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;

-- 3. Look at Null Values

-- the null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions all look normal. I don't think I want to change that
-- I like having them null because it makes it easier for calculations during the EDA phase

-- so there isn't anything I want to change with the null values

SELECT *
from layoffs_staging2;

SELECT *
from layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL
OR industry = '';

-- let's take a look at these
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%';
-- nothing wrong here

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Airbnb%';
-- it looks like airbnb is a travel, but this one just isn't populated.
-- I'm sure it's the same for the others. What we can do is
-- write a query that if there is another row with the same company name, it will update it to the non-null industry values
-- makes it easy so if there were thousands we wouldn't have to manually check them all

 
 UPDATE layoffs_staging2
 set industry = NULL
 WHERE industry = '';
 
 SELECT *
 FROM layoffs_staging2 as t1
 JOIN  layoffs_staging2 as t2
      ON t1.company = t2.company

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Travel'
WHERE company = 'Airbnb' AND industry IS NULL;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Consumer'
WHERE company = 'Juul' AND industry IS NULL;

SELECT *
